After seeing the "TheAlgorithms" repo on GitHub. I decided that the format of it would be a good way to showcase/store a bunch of smaller projects/snippets that I have done. Each class has it own main method to run the program.

# Math
## Trigonometry 
#### TriangleAngleSideSolver
Input either 2 angles & 1 side or 1 angle & 2 sides and it will output all of the angles and sides using the law of sine/law of cosine
 
## Geometry
#### CoordinateConversion3D
Will convert between Cartesian, Cylindrical, and Spherical coordinate systems in 3D space.
 
## Other
#### Armstrong
Checks to see if a number is an Armstrong number, an Armstrong number is a number that the sum of its digits raised to the third power is equal to the number itself.

#### Factorial
Calculates the factorial of an inputed number.

#### Fibonacci
Calculates the fibonacci number of an inputed number using a loop and recursion.

#### Power
Calculates the power of an inputed number using a loop and recursion.

#### Prime
Checks if a number is prime.

#### ReverseDecimalNumber
Reverses the decimal number entered.
 
# String
#### ConvertStringToNumber
Converts a short string into the ASCii values, offsets them, and then added them into one number.
 
#### ReverseStringWithStringBuilder 
Reverse a string using stringbuilder.
 
# algorithms 
## Conversions
#### AnyBasetoAnyBaseGUI
Will convert a number from one base to another base. Allows case sensitive ('a' != 'A'), which gives 62 bases and case insensitive ('a' = 'A'), which gives 36 bases. It provides a simple GUI.

#### BinaryToDecimal
Converts a binary number to a decimal.

## Sorts
#### SimplfiedBubbleSort
A simple bubble sort.

#### ModifiedBubbleSort
Modified bubble sort that uses a flag to determine, if the previous pass had a swap, if there was no swap it will stop the loop.

#### InsertionSort
An insertion sort.

#### SimplfiedSelectionSort
A simple selection sort.

#### ModifiedSelectionSort
Modified selection sort.
